# Do not touch this line. It will rewrite your config. 
# The old config will be saved as 'config.yml.old'
Version: ${project.version}

# This will only check for updates by default. You can also enable this to download them for you (I don't recommend this).
# This plugin does not break between minecraft versions so you should not have an issue updating to the most recent build.
# For this to work you need to add your curse api key to /plugins/updater/config.yml

#  no matter what other plugins try to do.  Honestly not sure what this really does...
IgnoreCancel: false

# Allows the durability of materials to gradually regenerate over time.
# Requires:  'MATERIAL.Durability.ResetEnabled: true'  in materials.yml and adjustment of timings.
# Example Timing Adjustment: 'OBSIDIAN.Durability.ResetAfter: 60000' for obsidian to regenerate 1 durability every minute

# False means that water and lava won't protect industructable materials from explosions.
# Only applies if the material is enabled in materials.yml
# This is a fix for the handling of blocks like obsidian that are not normally destroyable,
#  but become destroyed in water with this disabled.
FluidsProtectIndustructables: true

# Enables a bypass to allow explosions to affect ALL blocks under / next to liquids.
# This will bypass ALL blocks. We recommend not to use both this AND 'FluidsProtectIndustructables'.
